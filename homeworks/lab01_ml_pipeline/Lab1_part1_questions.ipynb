Thus, this step **will not change the performance**.\n",

        "   - This operation standardizes the pixel values across the entire dataset. While the L1 distance is invariant to shifting (subtracting $\\mu$), dividing by $\\sigma$ changes the scale of the distance between points, potentially affecting nearest neighbor relationships.

        "   - Rotating the coordinate axes modifies the relationship between the pixel values in space, which can affect the distance calculations. Since nearest neighbor classification relies on the relative positions of points in space, this rotation will definitely change the performance. Thus, this step **will change the performance**."

        "1. **The decision boundary (hyperplane between classes in feature space) of the k-NN classifier is linear.**\n",
        "   - **False.** The decision boundary of a k-NN classifier is generally **non-linear**. It can be very complex and is determined by the distribution of the training data points and the parameter \\( k \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **The training error of a 1-NN will always be lower than that of 5-NN.**\n",
        "   - **True.** In a k-NN classifier, the 1-NN (1-Nearest Neighbor) classifier will assign the label of the single nearest training example. Thus, it can perfectly classify the training points, leading to a training error of 0. In contrast, a 5-NN classifier averages its decision over the five nearest neighbors, which can potentially misclassify some training points.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **The test error of a 1-NN will always be lower than that of a 5-NN.**\n",
        "   - **False.** While a 1-NN classifier may fit the training data perfectly, it is also prone to overfitting and may perform poorly on unseen data (test set). Conversely, a 5-NN classifier can smooth out noise and may generalize better, thus leading to potentially lower test error than a 1-NN classifier, depending on the dataset.\n",

        "4. **The time needed to classify a test example with the k-NN classifier grows with the size of the training set.**\n",
        "   - **True.** In k-NN, to classify a test point, you typically need to compute the distance from the test point to all training points. Therefore, as the training set size increases, the time required for classification will also increase linearly with the number of training points.\n",
